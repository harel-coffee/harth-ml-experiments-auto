# Sequence length for prediction windows

SEQUENCE_LENGTH: 3000
# Value between 0 and 1 describing where to position a larger window
# e.g., 0 => no "future" samples only "past" samples considered
# e.g., 1 => only "future" samples, no "past" samples considered
# e.g., 0.5 => small window is centered, so that same amount of future and past samples are considered
