# HARTH Dataset and Machine Learning experiments
Baseline Machine Learning models for the Human Activity Recognition Trondheim (HARTH) dataset

## HARTH Dataset
The folder [harth](https://github.com/ntnu-ai-lab/harth-ml-experiments/tree/main/harth) contains the Human Activity Recognition Trondheim Dataset (HARTH), presented in [TODO]. It consists of acceleration data of 22 subjects, which wore two three-axial [Axivity AX3 (Axivity Ltd., Newcastle, UK)](https://axivity.com/product/ax3) accelerometers on the thigh and lower back.

#### Setup
- Acceleration signals
- 2 three-axial [Axivity AX3](https://axivity.com/product/ax3) accelerometers
- Attached to: thigh and lower back
